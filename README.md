# Odin Recipes
A basic recipe website with links to a few recipes.

In this project, I demonstrate some very basic HTML skills, such as:
- Basic website file structure
- HTML boilerplate
- Headings with h1-h6 tags
- Paragraphs with p tags
- Links with anchor tags
- Ordered lists with ol tags
- Unordered lists with ul tags
- Important text with strong tags
- Images with img tags and alt attributes for accessibility

I also demonstrate some basic CSS skills, such as:
- Classes, selectors, and the cascade
- CSS reset declarations
- Backgound and text colors
- Text fonts, size, line height, and alignment
- Outer display types
- Box model size and layout

These recipes are generated by ChatGPT. I cannot speak to their accuracy.
